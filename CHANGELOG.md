## v0.0.2 [2021-07-23]

- Utilising a new feature `optional qualifiers` to allow for faster targeted queries on certain tables `table_issue`, `table_merge_request` & `table_project`
- Enforced specific qualifiers **ONLY** when using the public hosted GitLab instance (to prevent errors / excessively long-running queries)
  - `table_issue` requires at least one of the following `assignee`, `assignee_id`, `author_id` or `project_id`
  - `table_merge_request` requires at least one of the following `assignee_id`, `author_id`, `reviewer_id` or `project_id`
  - `table_project` requires at least one of the following `owner_id` or `owner_username`
  - `table_user` requires at least one of the following `id` or `username`
